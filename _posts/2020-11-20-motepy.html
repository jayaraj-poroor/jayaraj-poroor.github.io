Abstract<br/>
<i>
A domain specific language (DSL), named MotePy is presented. The DSL offers a high level syntax with low overheads for ML/data processing in time constrained or memory constrained systems. The DSL-to-C compiler has a novel static memory allocator that tracks object lifetimes and reuses the static memory, which we call the compiler-managed heap.</i>
